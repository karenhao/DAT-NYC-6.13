Remember that **Git** and **GitHub** are not the same thing, and we can use **Git** locally as an application.

To do this, we will add a **remote** that connects us to our repo.  We will again use the url that we did with the clone command, writing `git remote add origin https://github.com/666hennessy666/DAT-NYC-6.13.git`.

We will also add a **remote** called `upstream` that connects us to the original repository containing the materials for the class.\n",
